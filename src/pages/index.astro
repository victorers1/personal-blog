			<h1>Hello, User</h1>
			<p>
				Here you'll find three things:
				<ul>
					<li>Home</li>
					<li>Notes</li>
					<li>About Me</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			This one you're seeing.

			<h3>Notes</h3>
			My goal is to spend less time searching these kind of stuff on Stack
			Overflow and ChatGPT. The purpose of this page is to serve as a mini
			documentation about the most trivial things about the technologies I
			am using at work or at home.

			<h3>About Me</h3>
			TL;DR: Computer Engineer working as a Flutter Developer. See <a
				href="/about">About Me</a
			> for the longer version.
