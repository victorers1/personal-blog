			<h1>ðŸ˜Ž Sample Text!</h1>
			<p>
				Here you'll find three things:
				<ul>
					<li>The Home</li>
					<li>My Blog</li>
					<li>About Me</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>Home</h2>
			Nothing to say, you're seeing right now.

			<h2>Blog</h2>
			Do you remember how to get the current year in Java? Or how to use
			the <code>qsort()</code> in C++? The purpose of this personal blog is
			to serve as a mini documentation about the most trivial things about
			the technologies I am using at work or at home. Also, my goal is to spend
			less time searching that on Stackoverflow and asking questions on ChatGPT.

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			TL;DR: Computer Engineer working undercover as a Flutter Developer.


			<h2>Original Template Text</h2>

			<p>
				This template comes with a few integrations already configured
				in your
				<code>astro.config.mjs</code> file. You can customize your setup
				with
				<a href="https://astro.build/integrations">Astro Integrations</a
				> to add tools like Tailwind, React, or Vue to your project.
			</p>
			<p>Here are a few ideas on how to get started with the template:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit this page in <code>src/pages/index.astro</code></li>
				<li>
					Edit the site header items in <code
						>src/components/Header.astro</code
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					Add your name to the footer in <code
						>src/components/Footer.astro</code
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					Check out the included blog posts in <code
						>src/pages/blog/</code
					>
				</li>
				<li>
					Customize the blog post page layout in <code
						>src/layouts/BlogPost.astro</code
					>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Have fun! If you get stuck, remember to <a
					href="https://docs.astro.build/"
					>read the docs
				</a> or <a href="https://astro.build/chat">join us on Discord</a
				> to ask questions.
