## Values

THe golden rule is: always deliver an increment at each sprint. To do that, you will need 5 values.

### Courage

A Scrum Team needs to be courageous to do the right thing, to do hard tasks and to resolve hard technical and interpersonal problems.

### Focus

The team has to focus on the current sprint and on the Scrum maintenance. That is nothing else to do inside a sprint.

### Commitment

The team personally commit to the sprint objectives. Never promise what you can't deliver.

### Respect

The people in the team respects each other both professionally and personally, even if they are Python programmers. The team can only succeed if everyone believes on each other capabilities and independency. No toxicity is allowed.

### Open to Changes

THe Scrum team and the stakeholder needs to agree to never change the current running sprint backlog, but this doesn't mean this will never happen. A well structured Scrum team will be capable of dealing with the minor changes (since it don't happens frequently).

## Roles

### Scrum Master

- Knows all about the Scrum framework (thus, Scrum *master*)
- Guides those that don't know how to Scrum
- Manages the processes and tools the team uses
- Conducts the Scrum events
- Facilitator
- Encourages the each team member to be independent
- Adapts the Scrum Framework to the project's reality

### Product Owner

- Responsible for the final product

### Developers

- Translates demands to a final product

## Artifacts

### Product Backlog

- Every undeveloped demand pointed by the Product Owner
- The single source of demands
- Demands here will be pushed to Sprint Backlog at the Spring Planning

### Sprint Backlog

- The undeveloped demands of a specific Sprint
- Populated on the Sprint Planning
- Emptied on the Sprint course

### Increment

- The result of the Sprint
- Equals to the old product added by a valuable increment
- The amount of increment is planned in the Sprint Planning

## Ceremonies

Every ceremony occurs inside a Sprint, there is nothing outside nor between Sprints. When a Sprint ends, other immediately begins.

### Sprint Planning

- Happens every start of Sprint, right after the retrospective
- Is usually when the team estimates each task effort
- Define how to increment the product's value

Roles:

- **Product Owner**: Influenced by the stakeholders, he/she brings the business objectives and, thus, the team objectives ordered by priority.

- **Scrum Master**: Conducts the reunion. Facilitates the communication between the members. Plans how the team will be able to reach the objectives.

- **Developers**: Pushes to the Sprint Backlog the right tasks to reach the current goal. Plans how they will be able to reach the objectives.

Artifacts:

### Daily Scrum

- Happens daily
- Must be quick
- Guests outside the Scrum team shouldn't participate
- Developers sync-up what they are doing
- Scrum Master and Product Owner are optional members

Roles:

- **Developers**: Each one give their own report to others developers and talk about blockers and risks, if any.

### Sprint Review

- Happens at the end of the Sprint
- Presentation of the increment delivered at the current Sprint
- It is presented by the Scrum team to the stakeholders

Roles:

- **Scrum Master**: Conducts the event. Guarantees that the ceremony occurs at the correct time and with the right duration.

- **Product Owner**: Observes the stakeholders and collects feedbacks as the presentation is happening.

### Sprint Retrospective

- Happens after the Sprint Review
- Team gather to reflect about the current Sprint, the people, the processes and tools used
- Time to suggest changes in the Scrum implementation aiming to improve the next Sprint
- Celebration time, after all you delivered value
- When this ceremony ends, a new Sprint starts

Roles:

- **Scrum Master**: Conducts the ceremony applying some interpersonal dynamic to involve all the team. Collects and analyses what has been discussed by the team.

Artifacts:

- Action plan to deal with the problems and improvements discussed with the team

## Other practices

### Refinement

- Isn't a Scrum official ceremony, but a good practice
- Can be an async practice, by chat
- Either done sync or asynchronously, shouldn't take more than 10% of the current Sprint time

Roles:

- **Product Owner**: Brings to discussion business objectives that will be relevant in a near future. Always points out blocks and risks.

- **Developers**: Answer the Product Owners doubts. Based in the discussion, proposes tasks to the Backlog. Estimates each task effort.
